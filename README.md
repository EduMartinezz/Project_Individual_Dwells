# GPS Data Analysis and Visualization

## Purpose

This repository contains Python code for the analysis and visualization of GPS data. The code is designed to process GPS data, estimate dwell periods, and create insightful visualizations to understand user behavior and spatial patterns.

## Code Overview

### Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Files

1. **gps_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for GPS data analysis and visualization.

2. **gps.csv**: Sample GPS data in CSV format. You can replace this file with your own GPS data.

3. **README.md**: Documentation explaining the purpose of the repository and instructions to run the code.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gps-analysis.git
   cd gps-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. If not, install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open and run the `gps_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter.

4. **Replace GPS Data:**

   Replace the sample `gps.csv` file with your own GPS data in CSV format. Ensure your data has the columns: `user_id`, `datetime`, `lat`, `lon`.

5. **Execute the Notebook:**

   Execute each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

## Additional Information

- The `gps_analysis.ipynb` notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code section.

- Customize the analysis by adjusting parameters such as `min_duration_minutes` for estimating dwell periods.

- Explore additional functionalities provided by pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to enhance the analysis.
