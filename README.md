GPS Data Analysis For Individual Dwell

This repository contains Python code for the analysis and visualization of GPS data. The code is designed to process GPS data, estimate dwell periods, and create insightful visualizations to understand user behavior and spatial patterns.

## Code Overview

### Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Files

1. GPS_Dwell_Codes.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for GPS data analysis and visualization.

2. (https://gps-london.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gps.csv): link of Sample GPS data in CSV format. You can replace this file with your own GPS data.

3. **README.md**: Documentation explaining the purpose of the repository and instructions to run the code.



2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. If not, install them using:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open and run the GPS_Dwell_Codes.ipynb notebook using Jupyter.

4. **Replace GPS Data:**

   Replace the sample gps.csv file with your own GPS data in CSV format. Ensure your data has the columns: `user_id`, `datetime`, `lat`, `lon`.

5. **Execute the Notebook:**

   Execute each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
